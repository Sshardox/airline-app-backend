# Dependency Issues Fixed

## 1. Incorrect Import in auth/router.py
- **Issue**: The file was importing `Any` from `anyio` instead of from `typing`.
- **Fix**: Changed `from anyio import Any` to `from typing import Any`.
- **Explanation**: `Any` is a type annotation used for function return types, and it should be imported from the `typing` module, not from `anyio` which is an asynchronous I/O library.

## 2. Restrictive Python Version in pyproject.toml
- **Issue**: The Python version was specified as exactly "3.9.8", which is too restrictive and could cause compatibility issues.
- **Fix**: Changed `python = "3.9.8"` to `python = "^3.9"`.
- **Explanation**: Using `^3.9` allows any Python 3.9.x version, making the project more flexible and compatible with different environments.

## 3. Incorrect Port Mapping in docker-compose.yml
- **Issue**: The PostgreSQL container was exposing port 6548 internally but mapping it to port 5432 on the host.
- **Fix**: Changed `5432:6548` to `5432:5432`.
- **Explanation**: The standard PostgreSQL port is 5432, so the correct mapping should be 5432:5432 to ensure that the database is accessible on the standard port both inside and outside the container.

## 4. Requirements.txt vs. Poetry
- **Note**: The project uses Poetry for dependency management (as seen in the Dockerfile and pyproject.toml), but there's also a requirements.txt file with minimal dependencies. This is not an issue as the Dockerfile correctly uses Poetry to generate a complete requirements.txt file during the build process.

## 5. Updated Import Statements for Python 3 Compatibility
- **Issue**: The project was using absolute imports within the package, which can cause issues in Python 3.
- **Fix**: Updated import statements in multiple files to use explicit relative imports (e.g., changed `from database import db` to `from ..database import db`).
- **Explanation**: Python 3 requires explicit relative imports within packages. Using explicit relative imports (with dot notation) makes the code more maintainable and ensures it works correctly regardless of how the application is run.

These fixes should resolve the dependency issues in the project and make it more robust and compatible with different environments.
